  <Card title="Type-safety" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Typesaurus helps to secure your Firestore database with type safety and makes your data 100% consistent.

    All document ids are types, so you'll never mix up a user id with an account id.

    It validates writes on type-level, preventing you from getting your documents into inconsistent states.
  </Card>

  <Card title="DRY" icon="random">
    Thesaurus is a universal package that allows sharing the same code on the web, server, and even React Native¹.

    It makes differences between environments invisible by default but will warn you when it's essential.

  <Card title="Firestore expert" icon="information">
    Typesaurus built with Firestore quirks in mind and based on years of experience building doses of production apps.

    Even if you don't know all Firesore's ins and outs, Typesaurus will help you avoid common pitfalls and make your code more robust.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Pleasure to use" icon="star">
    Typesaurus API is carefully designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

    Centralized schema allows easily to define, read and update your database structure.

    Single-import principle minimizes the number of imports and makes your code more readable.
  </Card>
    
  <Card title="Want more?" icon="rocket">
    Zero dependencies!

    Typesaurus is JavaScript-native. It converts Firestore data types, i.e. timestamp, to native JS types, i.e. Date.

    It's build size-efficient and minimizes the code you have to ship to the client.
