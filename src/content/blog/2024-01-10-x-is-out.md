## The best way to use Firestore with TypeScript is now even better!

TL;DR;

A new major version of type-safe ODM for Firestore is out with a brand new API and docs website.

## What is Typesaurus?

Typesaurus is a universal wrapper around Firestore Web and Admin SDKs, enabling you to use the same database code on the client and server. It allows you to define your database schema in TypeScript types and checks all operations for correctness. It helps to catch bugs, prevent runtime errors, and ensure data consistency. On top of that, it provides API sugar and a first-class React integration, is lightweight, and has zero dependencies. Interested?
